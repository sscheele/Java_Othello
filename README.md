# Java_Othello
Java implementation of the game "Othello" (aka Reversi) with networking

This is what I wrote for an APCS project a year or two ago for an APCS project. I added in networking over LAN, including using broadcasting to make the program more usable (you don't have to enter your opponent's IP, the server just broadcasts its IP until a client connects). Networking works for the most part, but I haven't implemented any kind of checking mechanism.

Files that start with "Old" are part of an older version of the projec that I left in in case I broke it :).

To run, just compile and run "ReversiDriver.java"
